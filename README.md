# Hi, I'm Gregory Robledo

I'm a student at **42**, a software engineering school where learning is project-based, peer-to-peer, and challenge-driven.  
Through 42’s unique approach, I’ve learned to adapt quickly, solve problems independently, and collaborate on complex technical projects.  

I am currently looking for an **internship or junior developer opportunity** to apply my skills, learn from experienced engineers, and contribute to real-world projects.

-   Always curious and continuously improving my skills in both **low-level programming (C/C++)** and **modern web development (TypeScript, Node.js)**  
-   Enjoy working in teams, especially on projects that require clean architecture and maintainable code
